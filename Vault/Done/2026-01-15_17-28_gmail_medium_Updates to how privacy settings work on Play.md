Hello Muhammad Abdullah,

We’ve updated settings that manage personalization and activity history on  
Play. You’ll have dedicated controls for personalization on Play and for  
saving activity in your Google Account’s Play History, and these settings  
will be easily accessible in the Google Play menu.

In the past, personalization and history on Play were managed by Web & App  
Activity (WAA) settings in your Google Account. Going forward, WAA will no  
longer control Play personalization and Play History. Instead, you’ll be  
able to manage those settings directly on Play, and you’ll see this change  
in your account in the next few days. Learn more about Play personalization  
and Play History  
<http://support.google.com/googleplay?p=personalize_play_migration>

When the transition happens for your account, your Play settings will be  
based on the most recent choice you made in WAA, so your experience will  
stay the same. If you have WAA turned on during the transition, which is  
happening over the next few days, then your Play personalization and Play  
History settings will be on, and if WAA is off, then Play personalization  
and Play History will be off. As before, you’ll be able to choose how long  
your activity is saved in your Play History and if you want to delete it  
from Play History manually or automatically.

After the transition is complete, WAA and Play settings will be separate,  
and changes to one will no longer affect the other. You can view and change  
your Play privacy settings in Personalization in Play  
<https://myactivity.google.com/product/google_play/personalization> at any  
time. Learn more about the transition and how it affects your settings

Thanks for using Google Play!
