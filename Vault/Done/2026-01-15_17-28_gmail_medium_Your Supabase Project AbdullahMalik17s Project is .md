Hi there,


To save on cloud resources I just did a scan of all our projects and identified those which have not seen sufficient activity for more than 7 days.

Your project AbdullahMalik17's Project (ID: cruhrmoayhxumhgbliwg) (https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cruhrmoayhxumhgbliwg) from your organization Voice_Assistant17 was one of those and it is scheduled to be paused in a couple of days.

Your project is not currently paused but if it continues not to receive sufficient activity it will be pause.

Once a project is paused
- We will send another email confirm that it has been paused
- You can unpause it from the [dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cruhrmoayhxumhgbliwg) within 90 days of the pause date. Beyond that point, you won't be able to unpause your project, but you'll be able to download your data.

To prevent future automatic pausing, upgrade to Pro from your billing settings: https://supabase.com/dashboard/org/skniodlcgzxszrgzapit/billing?panel=subscriptionPlan
