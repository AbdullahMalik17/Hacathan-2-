Amna signed in on a new device
Hi Muhammad Abdullah Muhammad Athar,
Amna Athar recently signed in to amnaathar251@gmail.com using Chrome.

You may want to consider other ways to manage this device. Not all of  
Family Link’s parental controls work here. For example:

*Can apply:*

    - Activity controls and other Google Account settings apply only when  
Amna is signed in to her account. Amna can sign out at any time.
    - Website restrictions apply only when Amna is signed in to Chrome and  
browsing in Chrome with her account. They don’t apply if Amna is signed out  
or using a different browser.

*Won't apply:*

    - You won't be able to see the location of this device in Family Link.
    - App activity and screen time controls won’t apply to this device.



*Don’t recognize this activity?*
We take your child's security very seriously and want to keep you in the  
loop on important actions with her account. If something doesn’t seem  
right, a parent can always reset Amna Athar's Google Account password  
<https://support.google.com/families?p=email_resetpassword> in Family Link  
to help protect it.

Best,
