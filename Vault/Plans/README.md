# Plans Directory

This folder contains strategic plans generated by the Digital FTE orchestrator for complex tasks.

## Structure

Each plan follows a standard format:
- Problem Analysis
- Approach & Strategy
- Implementation Steps
- Success Criteria
- Resources Needed
- Risk Assessment

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_[task-type]_[brief-description].plan.md
```

Example: `2026-01-17_14-30_technical_implement-auth-system.plan.md`

## Plan Types

- **Technical** - Code implementation, architecture decisions
- **Research** - Information gathering, analysis
- **Business** - Strategy, planning, decision-making
- **Integration** - Connecting systems, API design
- **Optimization** - Performance, refactoring

## Usage

Plans are automatically generated when the orchestrator detects:
- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- Technical decisions required
- Multiple approaches possible
- Research needed before implementation
- Architecture/design questions
