Hi there,

We are writing to let you know that on February 1, 2026, Render
will add ClickHouse, Inc. to its platform as a new subprocessor
(i.e., a service provider that processes data on our behalf).

What it's for:

ClickHouse provides data storage and processing for real-time
analytics. Render infrastructure will use ClickHouse to enable
rapid storage and retrieval of application and request logs for
user services. We are making this change to enhance the
performance of log exploration and search across the Render
Dashboard, API, and CLI.

What this means for you:

This change requires no action on your part. All subprocessors
are required to maintain rigorous protections in compliance with
Render's data processing obligations. Render will operate a
separate ClickHouse database in each of our regions to maintain
data residency.

View our complete list of subprocessors at
https://render.com/security.

Questions or concerns?

If you have any questions about this change or Render's data
processing practices, please reach out to our Support team in
the Render Dashboard.

Thank you for choosing Render. We're committed to keeping you
informed about how we operate our platform.


Best,
The Render Team
