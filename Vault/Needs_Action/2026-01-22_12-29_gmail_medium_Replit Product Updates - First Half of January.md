Thursday, January 22, 2026


We’re barely a few weeks into the year and the Replit product factory is 
already running hot.

If the last year was about agents getting smarter, this year is about putting 
them (and you) everywhere.

Over the past two weeks we’ve shipped a wave of updates that make it easier to 
shipnative mobile apps, inspect what your agents are really doing, and wire in 
thelatest LLMs—all without leaving Replit.

But before we get into the bits and bytes, some words of inspiration:


  



💡 Words of Inspiration


Replit exists so that more people can shape the software running the world—not 
just read about it.

“The future is already here — it’s just not evenly distributed.”

— William Gibson, science fiction author

Everything in this email is about pushing more of that future into your 
browser: powerful runtimes, stronger agents, and native apps you can ship from 
a prompt.


 

🔥 Highlights


 * Spin up native iOS apps from a prompt, preview via QR code, and ship to the 
App Store from Replit
 * Cleaner tool call UI in Agent Chat so you can see what your agents are 
doing at a glance
 * Automation step graph preview so agent builders get feedback in seconds, 
not minutes
 * Private apps on free plans, with a small “Made with Replit” badge you can 
remove with Core
 * replit ai in Shell + new GPT, Claude, and Gemini models in AI Integrations
 * Node.js security patch rolled out across Agent environments and Node apps

 

📱 Build native iOS apps from a prompt


 You can now go from idea → installable iOS app without ever touching Xcode.

Ask Replit’s Agent to “build a habit‑tracking iOS app with login, a Postgres 
database, and Stripe for subscriptions,” and it generates a fullReact Native 
project wired up with your stack.


 *  Plug in databases, Stripe, or OpenAI without hand‑rolling boilerplate
 * Scan a QR code with Expo Go to preview your app instantly
