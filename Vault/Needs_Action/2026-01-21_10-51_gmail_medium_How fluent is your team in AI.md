Hey, Wade here. 

 One of the things we realized early on is that it's not enough to give people 
access to AI tools, you've got to build fluency.

We started looking at it on a simple scale. Not scientific, but it helps: 
 * Level 1: Haven't touched it 
 * Level 2: Played with ChatGPT a few times 
 * Level 3: Using AI in day-to-day workflows 
 * Level 4: Rethinking how they work because of it  Most folks start somewhere 
in the middle. What matters is how quickly they move up.

 We use this fluency scale across hiring, team coaching, even performance 
reviews. It's helped us go from curiosity to full-on adoption, andthat's where 
the real upside kicks in
