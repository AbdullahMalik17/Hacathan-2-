# Drafts Folder

This folder contains draft responses and actions generated by the **Cloud Agent**.

## Purpose

- **Cloud Agent (24/7 VM)** monitors incoming tasks and creates drafts
- Drafts are saved here for human review
- **Local Agent** pulls drafts and displays them in Obsidian for approval
- Human reviews and approves/rejects drafts before execution

## Workflow

```
1. Cloud Agent detects new task (email, WhatsApp, LinkedIn)
2. Cloud Agent generates draft response (AI-powered)
3. Cloud Agent saves draft to this folder
4. Cloud Agent pushes to Git (syncs to Local)
5. Local Agent pulls and displays draft in Obsidian
6. Human reviews and approves/rejects draft
7. If approved, Local Agent executes action
8. Task moves to Done/ folder
```

## File Format

**Filename:** `{timestamp}_{source}_{priority}_{slug}.md`

Example: `2026-01-22_1430_gmail_high_Q4-report-request.md`

# Task: [Title]

## Original Context
[Original email/message content]

## Proposed Response (DRAFT)
[AI-generated response]

## Reasoning
- Classification: [domain, priority]
- Action Required: [what needs to be done]
- Risk Level: [low/medium/high]

## Required Approval
- [ ] Review proposed response
- [ ] Verify attachments/data
- [ ] Approve and execute
```

## Security Notes

- **Cloud Agent cannot execute actions** - only creates drafts
- **All drafts require human approval** before execution
- **Audit trail** for all drafts in `Logs/audit/`
- **No secrets exposed** - credentials only on Local agent
