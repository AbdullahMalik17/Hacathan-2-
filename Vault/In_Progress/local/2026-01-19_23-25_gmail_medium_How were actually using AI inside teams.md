Hey, Wade here again. 

 A lot of people ask how we've driven such high AI adoption. I get it. New 
tech can feel like hype until it becomes a habit.

 For us, it's been about real examples over roadmaps. Show and tell. Leaders 
who aren't just talking about AI, but using it themselves. And sometimes, the 
little things spark the big shifts.

If you're leading a team or trying to get one on board, here are a few things 
to check out: 
 * My new podcast, Agents of Scale 
<https://agentsofscale.transistor.fm/subscribe/?utm_campaign=itbl-gbl-awr-ooc-aos_podcast_email_onboaring-mktg&utm_medium=email&utm_source=iterable>
, where I have candid conversations with other C-suite leaders scaling AI 
across their organizations 
 * Brandon, our Chief People Officer, walks through how HR uses AI for 
onboarding and engagement <https://zapier.com/l/hr-ai-ama> 
 * Visit our Webinar Library <https://zapier.com/resources/webinar> to get 
inspired for how to start building with AI 
 * A free IT guide on rolling out AI safely across your org 
<https://zapier.com/resources/guides/ai-automation-it-guide>, with guardrails 
that avoid the shadow tool mess  We're still figuring it out. But we're 
shipping faster and more confidently than we were a year ago. You can too.

 More soon,
 Wade
