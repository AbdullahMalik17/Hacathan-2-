Here's what's new


We've shipped several updates to Claude Code designed to help you build more, 
faster. From new ways to access Claude Code to the diff viewer on web and 
desktop, here are five new features and tools for a better Claude Code 
experience.



Cowork (research preview)

Cowork brings the power of Claude Code to non-coding tasks (no terminal 
required). Open the desktop app, connect your files and tools, and let Claude 
get things done. Available now for Max and Pro subscribers on macOS.

VS Code extension is generally available (GA)

Previously in beta, Claude Code for VS Code is now GA and is closer to the CLI 
experience: @-mention files for context, use familiar slash commands (/model, 
/mcp, /context), and more.

Install from the VS Code marketplace
