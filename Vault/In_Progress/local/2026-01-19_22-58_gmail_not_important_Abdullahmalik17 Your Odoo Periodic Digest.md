Tip: Become a paperless company*
An easy way to process incoming mails is to configure your scanner to send PDFs to inbox@abdullahmalik17.odoo.com. Scanned files will appear automatically in your folder. Then, process your documents in bulk with the split tool: launch user defined actions, request a signature, convert to vendor bills with AI, etc.
