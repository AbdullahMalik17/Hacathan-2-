Welcome to Zapier Agents

Nice job creating your first Zapier Agent! You've just taken the first step 
toward having a personal AI teammate that works autonomously to handle 
specialized tasks across your apps. 

 Take a video tour →  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD6ds_chB2U> 
Here's how to get your agent working for you: 
 * Create specialized agents: Build powerful agents in minutes by describing 
what you want them to do in plain language. Our prompt assistant guides you 
through the process, making it easy to create agents for specific business 
functions. 
 * Connect your apps: Give your agent access to apps like HubSpot, Notion, or 
Asana from our library of8,000+ integrations <https://zapier.com/apps>, so it 
can work with your live data and make smart decisions. 
 * Monitor your agent's work: Stay informed with our new Activity dashboard 
that shows exactly what your agents are accomplishing behind the scenes. Easily 
spot when your agent needs your input with the "Needs action" filter.  The best 
part? Your agents work independently in the background, handling routine tasks 
so you can focus on what matters most. No code required—just tell your agent 
what job to do, and let it work while you sleep.
