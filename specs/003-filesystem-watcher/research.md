# Research Findings: Sprint 2 (FS Watcher & CEO Briefing)

## 1. Filesystem Watcher (`src/watchers/filesystem_watcher.py`)

### Existing Implementation
- Uses `watchdog` library.
- Monitors `DropFolder` by default.
- Has debouncing logic (5s).
- Categorizes files and suggests actions in Markdown.

### Gaps
- **Rate Limiting**: Missing FR-005 (max 50 tasks/hour).
- **Multiple Paths**: Current main only supports one folder.
- **Safety**: Categorization is good, but "Delete" suggestion should be clearly flagged.

## 2. CEO Briefing (`src/reports/ceo_briefing.py`)

### Existing Implementation
- Aggregates logs from `Vault/Logs/*.json`.
- Calculates counts by source and action.
- Detects errors and pending items.
- Generates professional Markdown report.

### Gaps
- **ROI Computation**: Missing quantitative value calculation (SC-005).
- **Claude Synthesis**: Missing the narrative summary generated by LLM (FR-003).
- **Email Distribution**: Currently saves to file but doesn't send via MCP (FR-005).
- **Scheduling**: Relies on external Task Scheduler.

## 3. Technical Decisions

### ROI Calculation
- Assign fixed values:
  - Email processing: $2.00
  - File categorization: $1.00
  - WhatsApp triage: $1.50
  - Error recovery: $5.00
- These are placeholders based on "time saved" multiplied by "hourly rate".

### Claude Synthesis
- Reuse the `DigitalFTEOrchestrator.invoke_agent` pattern or a simplified version to pass metrics to Claude.
- Prompt: "Summarize this week's FTE performance. Metrics: {metrics}. Logs: {logs}."
